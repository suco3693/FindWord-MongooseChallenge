Congratulations on making it to this stage of the interview process! This part consists of small challenges
to test your knowledge of fundamental coding principles and Node.js. Having previous knowledge of the concepts 
covered is a plus but is not required, we place a lot of value in your ability to pick up and implement new 
concepts quickly and accurately. 

This coding challenge consists of 2 parts:
1) find_words.js: Implement an algorithm to find all words in a grid of letters
2) incorrect.js: Fix bugs in a file that handles processing of documents in 2 simple collections (users, payments)

For (1), please implement your solution in find_words.js, and for (2), write the corrected code in correct.js.

For both parts, you can google and research general concepts (e.g., looking up Node.js documentation) on your own 
but we kindly ask that you don't communicate with anyone about the problems.

Feel free to reach out to us at any time if you have any questions. Happy coding!
